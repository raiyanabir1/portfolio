            <p>In future(after My CSE) if I really wants to become a good programmer then I have to do practice coding/programming daily. If I practice daily then day by day my coding skills will improve and it helps to increase my analytical and logical skills.

I have to start programming from C Language then C++ ..etc

Depending upon my college syllabus each semester I will learn new programming language.

Here is the list,

If you want to get job from your college campus then before going to final year you have to learn or do class of Aptitude and English. Which will helps you in 1st round of campus interviews.

Another thing is that if you want to increase your logical skills then learn Data Structure and Algorithms in very deeply with different languages like C, C++ and Java, it will helps you lot and increase your problem solving skills.

This is enough for you now.</p>
