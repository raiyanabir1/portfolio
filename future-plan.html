            <p>In future(after My CSE) if I really wants to become a good programmer then I have to do practice coding/programming daily. If I practice daily then day by day my coding skills will improve and it helps to increase my analytical and logical skills.

I have to start programming from C Language then C++ ..etc

Depending upon my college syllabus each semester I will learn new programming language.

If I want to get job My college campus then before going to final year I have to learn or do class of Aptitude and English. Which will helps me in 1st round of campus interviews.

Another thing is that if I want to increase My logical skills then learn Data Structure and Algorithms in very deeply with different languages like C, C++ and Java, it will help me lot and increase my problem solving skills.

This is enough for me now.</p>
